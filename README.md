# Application-Centric Enablement (ACE)

The "application-centric" enablement methodology provides students with a framework that they can follow to learn about cloud applications and all the prequisite knowledge they need to fulfill a variety of technical roles. 

It is meant to complement, not replace, self-paced or instructor-led instruction. For a Systems Engineer, it is mean to be used at this stage in his/her journey.

At the heart of the framework is a cloud application, around which courseware, lab work, and all manner of enablement activities are built. This provides an organized, cohesive, learning experience.

Any cloud native application can be used within the framework. However, as a baseline, the out-of-the-box instructions and exercises in this document will use the GCP microservices-demo application: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.

## Learning objectives

At the completion of the enablement activities associated with this framework, students will:

- Be able to explain the purpose of an application and demonstrate its use
- Understand how the application works and the underlying technology behind it
- Know manual and automated methods of deploying the application
- Know how to use a CNAPP to secure the application

## Getting started

At a high-level, using the ACE framework involves the following steps:

1. Select a supported Cloud Service Provider (CSP) that will host the application
2. Configure the CSP environment as required by the CNAPP that will protect it
3. Deploy the application to the CSP environment
4. Protect the application with a CNAPP

Out-of-the-box guidance for accomplishing the steps above will be based on the above-mentioned baseline application.
