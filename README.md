# Application-centric enablement

The "application-centric" enablement methodology provides students with a framework that they can follow to learn about cloud applications and all the prequisite knowledge they need to perform a variety of technical roles. At the heart of the framework is a cloud application, around which courseware, lab work, and all manner of enablement activities are built. This provides an organized, cohesive, learning experience.

At the end of the enablement activity, students will:

Be able to explain the purpose of an application and demonstrate its use
Understand how the application works and the underlying technology behind it
Know manual and automated methods of deploying the application
Know how to secure the application
